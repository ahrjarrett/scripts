My scripts for bootstrapping a dev environment on a fresh macOS installation.

- Looking for my dotfiles? [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/dotfiles][Here they are]].
- About to reformat? See the [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/scripts/blob/master/preflight.org][Preflight Checklist]]

* What it sets up

Somewhat Sane Defaults:
- The [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/scripts/blob/master/bootstrap/osx.sh][OS X defaults file]] is heavily commented so you can take out the parts you don‚Äôt want


** Tools:
- [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] for managing operating system libraries
- [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][The Silver Searcher]] for finding things in files
- [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] for finding files in things
- [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell][üç£ fish ]] on the command-line 
- [[https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish][oh-my-fish]] as your shell package manager
- [[https://httpie.org/][HTTPie]] for making REST requests from the command-line


** Apps:
- See out the [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/scripts#installed-os-x-apps][full list of apps]] this script installs


* Install

1. Clone this repo anywhere on your machine
2. /Read the scripts/! ~osx.sh~ in particular does a lot of opinonated stuff to your machine
3. Run ~sh bootstrap/bootstrap.sh~

That‚Äôs it! Altogether it takes around 20 minutes.


* What it does


** Symlinks

Upon bootstrap, this script generates an SSH key and uses it to install my [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/dotfiles][dotfiles]] repo.

If you configure this on your own dotfiles repo, be warned that this script will symlink /every file and folder you have in there/ to your home directory, *unless*:

1. it‚Äôs an ~.org~ or ~.md~ file
2. it lives inside the ~.excludes/~ directory (files you need/want to install manually here)
3. it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd probably add to a ~/.gitignore~ file (for example ~/.DS_Store~)

This can lead to surprising behavior if you're not expecting it.

See [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/scripts/blob/master/bootstrap/link.sh#L3][excluded files regex]] to alter this behavior.


** Brew install

Homebrew installs a bunch of packages and applications for you.

See [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/brew.sh][brew.sh]] to change what will be installed. Note that *Cask will force app installs*.

Meaning if an app already exists in your Applications folder, _it will be removed and reinstalled_. This will ensure you get the latest version, but might also lose that app‚Äôs config.

** Debugging

See the [[https://github.com/ahrjarrett/dotfiles#postinstall-checklist][Postinstall Checklist]] if something goes wrong (or if you‚Äôre looking to do more advanced config).


** TODO Known Issues:

*TODO:* oh-my-fish gets excited sometimes and interrupts

During shell configuration, sometimes OMF will decide to launch fish, interrupting the process.

This doesn't break anything, you just have to run the bootstrap script again (I‚Äôd skip the SSH and Homebrew steps the 2nd time around).

*TODO:* fix fzf being fishy.

If ~fzf~ doesn't work right away after configuring fish, try making sure Oh My Fish is up to date and on the ~dev~ channel by doing:

   ~$ omf channel dev~
   
   ~$ omf update~
   
You'll know it's working if you can hit =^+R= or =^+F= to search through history, or find a file.
