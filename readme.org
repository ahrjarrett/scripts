scripts

My scripts for bootstrapping a dev environment on a fresh Arch Linux or macOS installation.

** Install:

Clone and cd into this repo, then follow the instructions according to your OS.

** Arch Install:

You can pass the install script the ~-h~ flag for a list of configuration options.

~cd arch && install.sh~

** macOS Install:

See the readme in the ~macos~ repo for instructions.

** TODO:

Build out ~shared~ folder that is OS-independent
