You just ran the bootstrap script. Cool. Here’s some stuff you might consider next:

** TODO Configure Chrome

   
*** TODO 1. Import Google Profile

- [ ] Log into Google account(s)
- [ ] Run through list of required extensions below
- [ ] Upload ~vimium-settings.json~ file (~.exclude/chrome/vimium-options.json~)
- [ ] Import your bookmarks (or dare to start fresh?)
- [ ] Add custom Styler files from [[marketplace_customizations][https://github.com/ahrjarrett/marketplace-customizations]] repo
- [ ] [Optional] Go through tips & tricks section

*** TODO 2. Install Extensions

Visit [[chrome://extensions]] to see and configure your extensions

*** TODO 3. Customize Search Engines

**** Customize URL Bar Queries

*Shortcut:* 

1. Do ~Cmd + ,\~  anywhere in Chrome or navigate to [[chrome://settings]] 
2. Search for "Manage Search Engines"

*My Custom Queries:*

| Search engine          | Keyword | Query URL                                            |
|------------------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------|
| Chrome Pages           | chr     | chrome://%s                                          |
| deselectOmnibox        | q       | javascript:                                          |
| deselectOmnibox        | z       | javascript:                                          |
| Drive Images           | img     | https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=%s       |
| GitHub                 | gh      | https://github.com/search?q=%s&ref=opensearch        |
| MarketPlace            | zz      | http://admin.austin.ownlocal.com/businesses?query=%s |
| marketplace ad search  | oo      | https://louismagdaleno.com/?q=%s                     |
| marketplace biz search | bz      | http://admin.austin.ownlocal.com/businesses/%s       |
| Chrome Pages           | chr     | chrome://%s                                          |
  

*** 4. Tips & Tricks

*Tip:* If you’re looking to configure Chrome, [[chrome://chrome-urls]] is my favorite place to start.

It’s basically a sitemap for everything configurable in Chrome. From there I access links like these:

- [[chrome://bookmarks]]
- [[chrome://flags]] -- /Chrome will do some really neat stuff if you know to ask it to/
- [[chrome://network-errors]]
- [[chrome://omnibox]]
- [[chrome://signin-internals]]
- [[chrome://site-engagement]] -- /basically a report card of all the sites that waste your time/
- [[chrome://user-actions]] -- /keep this open and it will log of your actions in the background. cool./
- chrome://quit -- /alt-f4 turns on god mode/

**** Flags (Experimental)

Here are some flags I like to turn on. Read what they do first, etc etc.

| Latest stable JavaScript features            | #disable-javascript-harmony-shipping | Enabled |
| 3D software rasterizer                       | #disable-software-rasterizer         | Enable  |
| Debugging for packed apps                    | #debug-packed-apps                   | Enabled |
| Hardware-accelerated video decode            | #disable-accelerated-video-decode    | Enabled |
| Creation of app shims for hosted apps on Mac | #disable-hosted-app-shim-creation    | Enabled |

If you’re really feeling adventurous, check out [[https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/][Chrome Canary]].

** DONE Installed OS X Apps

*Complete!*

You already did this when you bootstraped. This step is no longer done manually.

However if the bootstrap failed you’ll want to check if any of these failed to install:

- [x] Chrome - [[https://www.google.com/chrome/b][Download]]
- [x] Dropbox - [[https://www.dropbox.com/install][Download]]
- [x] Emacs - (copy from iCloud if borked)
- [x] Keycastr - [[https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr][Download]]
- [x] Sequel Pro - [[https://sequelpro.com/download][Download]]
- [x] Sketch - [[https://www.sketch.com/get/][Download]]
- [x] Slack - [[https://slack.com/downloads/mac][Download]]
- [x] Spectacle - [[https://www.spectacleapp.com/][Download]]
- [x] Spotify - [[https://www.spotify.com/download][Download]]
- [x] The Unarchiver - [[https://theunarchiver.com/][Download]]
- [x] VLC - [[https://www.videolan.org/vlc/][Download]]
- [x] VS Code - [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx][Download]]

** DONE Symlink dotfiles & configure shell

*Complete!*

You already did this when you bootstrapped. This step is no longer done manually.

If it turns out you’re missing something from the dotfiles repo, check the iCloud ~dotfiles_stash~ backup you made during Preflight.


** Passwords, secret files, etc.

Whoops, none of my config secrets live on Github.

Check iCloud for a file called ~random-configs.org~ for VPN config and other SSH logins.
